This is a custom ColdFusion script that is used to debug session variables

To use: Place the <code>SessionInfo.cfm</code> file in the same directory as the script or scripts you wish to debug. You can then call it by putting the tag <code><cf_sessioninfo></code> into the script that you are debugging.
